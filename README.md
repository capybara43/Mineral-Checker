# Mineral-Checker
Python program to check minerals - both python and micropython for microbit

A python program that asks for the hardness, transparency, streak and magentism of an unknown mineral and then checks its databse for a match.

A version for both python and micropython exists, allowing it to be run on the microbit.

To run the PC version without installing Python and running from within the development environment, just unzip the dist.zip file to a directory in a convenient location, then double click on the minerals.exe and the program will run. To unzip, most windows installations will allow you to double click on the dist.zip file, then 'extract all'.
