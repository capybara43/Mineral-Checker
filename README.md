# Mineral-Checker
Python program to check minerals - both python and micropython for microbit

A python program that asks for the hardness, transparency, streak and magentism of an unknown mineral and then checks its databse for a match.

A version for both python and micropython exists, allowing it to be run on the microbit.

To run the PC version without installing Python and running from within the development environment, download the dist.zip file.

Then move the dist.zip file to a directory in a convenient location. Then double click on the dist.zip file and in most windows installations a message asking you to 'extract all' will pop up. Accept this then double click on the 'minerals.exe' file in the extracted folder and the program will run. If it doesn't ask you to extract all automatically,  you may have to download 7-zip or another zip utility in order to extract.
